    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I was a research assistant in molecular and cellular biology, focusing on data analysis and automation. I taught myself Python to streamline biomedical data management. To enhance my technical skills, I studied computer science at the University of the People and completed web development projects. Through Northeastern University’s Information Systems program, I aim to improve biomedical data management. My long-term goal is to become a bio-development consultant, helping Taiwanese companies accelerate R&D with software solutions.</p>
